# MERN Stack Authentication Project

This project is a simple authentication application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The primary goal is to demonstrate the usage of the [matrix-hasher.js](https://github.com/ZiyaKolcu/matrix-hasher.js) library for secure password encryption.

## Features

- User Signup
- User Signin
- User Signout
- Protected profile page displaying the user's information (username and email)
- Password encryption using `matrix-hasher.js` library

## Matrix-Hasher Library
This project utilizes the custom [matrix-hasher.js](https://github.com/ZiyaKolcu/matrix-hasher.js) library for password encryption. The matrix-hasher.js library provides matrix-based encryption and includes functions for password hashing and comparison. It offers a usage pattern similar to bcrypt.js, with no dependencies.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, Vite
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Password Encryption: [matrix-hasher.js](https://github.com/ZiyaKolcu/matrix-hasher.js)
